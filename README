Multiple Inheritance in C++
===========================

A diamond class inheritance diagram:

       ----------
       | base_t |
       ----------
          ^  ^
         /    \
        /      \
       /        \      
 ----------   ----------
 | der1_t |   | der2_t |
 ----------   ----------
       ^        ^
        \      /
         \    /
          \  /
       ----------
       | der3_t |
       ----------


TERMINAL OUTPUT:
================

base class constructor called
base            x: 0

base class constructor called
der1 class constructor called
derived 1       x: 1

base class constructor called
der2 class constructor called
derived 2       x: 2

base class constructor called
der1 class constructor called
der2 class constructor called
der3 class constructor called
derived 3       x: 2
